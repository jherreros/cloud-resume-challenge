Welcome to a new post of the blog!

Today I want to tell you about how I've managed to put the website code on a Version Control System (VCS), so that every time that I make some changes to it, these are registered and then I can easily track them. This also allows me to quickly revert a change, if for any reason it caused the site to stop working.

Together with that, I have set up a pipeline so that the website gets automatically deployed every time I push some changes to this VCS.

#### Version controlling the code: Creating a GitHub repository

#### Using a pipeline to deploy the site: AWS CodeBuild
